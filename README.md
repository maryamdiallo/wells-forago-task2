This repository showcases my work from the Wells Fargo Software Engineering Virtual Work Simulation Project on the Forage platform. As a project analyst, I focused on designing a data model for a system that helps financial advisors manage their clients' portfolios more effectively. My contributions are highlighted in two key tasks:

Data Model and Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) Design:
I developed a detailed ERD to meet the project requirements, serving as a blueprint for the development team to create a robust relational database. This process enhanced my understanding of how ERDs are fundamental to database design and system architecture.

Implementing the Data Model in Java:
Building on the ERD, I implemented the data model using Java in Visual Studio Code. This involved creating classes for each entity, annotating them with @Entity for ORM integration, enabling auto-generation of primary keys, and adding constructors, getters, and setters to manage entity attributes efficiently.

This project honed my skills in both designing and implementing scalable data models, essential for developing modern financial management systems.
